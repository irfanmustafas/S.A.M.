# S.A.M.
An app that works with a databases and location beacons to store information about students on a school campus.
I made this app at BaseHacks 3.0
I used google firebase to get a remote database which tracks attendance and is updated in real time as students walk by the estimote beacons.
I also implemented messaging in order for the admin to send all students emergency messages in the case of an emergency.
