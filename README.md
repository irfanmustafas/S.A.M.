An Android app that works with a databases and location beacons to store information about students on a school campus.
I made this app at BaseHacks 3.0, where it won Best Use of Estimote Beacons
I used google firebase to get a remote database which tracks attendance and is updated in real time as students walk by the estimote beacons.In essence, it automatically takes roll.
The app keeps track of student's locations so that they can easily be found during an emergency, such as a fire.
I also implemented messaging in order for the admin to send all students emergency messages in the case of an emergency.
This is helpful in case important information needs to be communicated to every student but this information cannot be broadcast over the intercom. For example, one message could read "Suspicious figure in the E building, head inside a classroom immediately".
